# StockSiteDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.6. I created this project to learn about how Angualr components work, and how to connect to a server with Angular.

## How to Run

Run `ng serve --open` in the apps folder to run. This should open it on a new tab on your default brower. If not, Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To get the server to run, navigate to the server folder and run `nodemon index.js.`

Be sure to install the necessary node modules using `npm install [insert node module here]`

For privacy reasons, I have removed my API KEY and Database Connection URL from this Demo. If you would like a LIVE Demo be sure to ask (email: 18dwhyte.stem@gmail.com) and I can provide one as it will be stored locally on my computer. Or you can create your own free MongoDB and get a free API key from Finnhub.io

## The Goal
I wanted to learn more about Angular so I focused on learning Typescript, how to set-up components and backend, and sending HTTP requests. I additionally added Bootstrap so I could learn how to configure it to my project.

## API Connection

I was able to parse server data to the client using Angular's HTTP request library. The Data shows the latest current stock price, stock percent change, company logo, stock name, and abbreviation.
